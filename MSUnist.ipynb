        "For our Final project we have decided to work on the classic digit recognition problem. Taking a spin on the classic MNSIT dataset we have decided to collect our own dataset from study around the Auraria campus housing the three schools MSU Denver, CU Denver, and CCD. We decided to take this approach because we believe that as machine learning students it is not only important to understand not just the application of machine learning but also the data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing that goes into it. We believe that this will give us a better understanding of the process and the challenges that come with it as well as the importance of data quality."
